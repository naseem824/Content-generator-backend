# Modules (Content Generation Only)

1. **Metadata & Schema Module:**
    - Using the provided brief, generate an A/B test-worthy, action-oriented SEO Title and Meta Description that includes a compelling benefit and a call-to-action.
    - Generate a list of the top 7-10 conversion-intent Meta Keywords based on the brief's analysis.
    - Schema Integration: You MUST populate the placeholders in a LocalBusiness or Service JSON-LD schema with relevant details from the brief and brand voice file.

2. **Superior Conversion Copywriting Module:**
    - Write the full landing page copy, strictly adhering to the **Proposed Landing Page Outline** from the Strategic Brief.
    - Clarity & Persuasion Discipline: Your copy MUST be concise, scannable, and relentlessly focused on the user's needs. The goal is conversion, not word count.
    - Competitor-Beating Quality: Your writing must be more persuasive and emotionally resonant than the competitor's. Directly address the reader using "You" and "Your."
    - **CRITICAL:** You must subtly and naturally weave in the **Core Messaging & Semantic Keyword Clusters** provided in the Strategic Brief to ensure deep topical relevance for SEO.
    - **CRITICAL CITATION RULE:** When you include a proof point from the **Researched Proof Points** section of the brief, you MUST write the plain text source URL immediately after it in parentheses.

3. **Value-Add CTA & FAQ Module:**
    - Generate 3-5 compelling, action-oriented variations for the main Call-to-Action buttons.
    - Create a valid `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema containing the **Objection-Handling FAQ** questions and answers from the brief.

4. **Final Output Formatting Module:**
    - Assemble all generated components into a single block of text.
    - **CRITICAL:** The entire output must be formatted in clean Markdown, using # for the Main Headline, ## for Section Headlines, etc.
    - Structure the final output with three separators: ---METADATA---, ---SCHEMAS---, and ---LANDING PAGE COPY---.
