# Modules (Content Generation Only)

1.  **Metadata & Schema Module:**
    -   Using the provided brief's topic, generate an A/B test-worthy SEO Title and Meta Description.
    -   Generate a list of the top 7-10 Meta Keywords based on the brief's analysis.
    -   **CRITICAL SCHEMA MANDATE:** You MUST generate a complete and valid `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD schema. Populate it **using the details provided in the user's Brand Data file** (Business Name, Contact, URL, Address, Lat/Long, etc.). Do not use placeholders if the information is available in the Brand Data.

2.  **Superior Content Writing Module:**
    -   **CRITICAL WORD COUNT MANDATE:** Your primary objective in this module is to meet the word count target. You MUST generate a total article body word count of AT LEAST **{target_word_count} words**. This is not optional. Failure to meet this word count will result in an incomplete task.
    -   **STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE WORD COUNT:** To reach the target, you must be descriptive, provide detailed explanations, and use analogies and examples to expand on each point in the provided outline. Do not write short, summary-style paragraphs. Go into depth on every H2 and H3 topic from the brief.
    -   **EXECUTION:** Write the full article, strictly adhering to the **Proposed Exhaustive Article Outline** from the Strategic Brief.
    -   **QUALITY:** Your writing must be more detailed, practical, and insightful than the competitor's. Proactively answer unstated user questions.
    -   **CITATION RULE:** When you include a fact or statistic from the **Researched Data Points & Statistics** section of the brief, you MUST write the plain text source URL immediately after it in parentheses.

3.  **Value-Add FAQ Module:**
    -   Using the article's topic, generate 4-6 "People Also Ask" style questions with concise answers.
    -   Create a valid `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema containing these questions and answers.

4.  **Final Output Formatting Module:**
    -   Assemble all generated components into a single block of text.
    -   **CRITICAL:** The entire output must be formatted in clean Markdown, using `#` for H1, `##` for H2s, `###` for H3s, etc.
    -   Structure the final output with three separators: `---METADATA---`, `---SCHEMAS---`, and `---ARTICLE---`.
